# üìñ My Story

I have a passion for teaching and mentoring since I can remember myself. I have been tutoring other kids since I was 11, and at the age of 16 I opened an after-school program to help elemntry school students prepare for junior-high.

At 18, I was servicing in a reconnaisance unit in the IDF, and continued to serve for 8 years in different data-related technical positions. There I relaized my passion for technology, and numbers (learning for a bachelor's in Mathematics in Tel Aviv university).

After the army, I went to prepare students for SAT exams (university admissions tests) in a school specializing in teaching students with ADHD and learning disorders.

Eventually, I managed the entire educational department, and later continued to manage the development of all digital products of the school.

At this point, after 5 years not being involved in technology, I noticed that I really want to combine education and technology. I quit the SAT school (after 10 years!) and pursued a position as a software engineer.

After two years as a lead software engineer in the health care sector, building some of the most innovative products in the Netherlands, I finally found a position that combines both of my passions.

Now, I am responsible for creating some of the most innovative TechEd programs in [Masterschool](https://www.masterschool.com), soon to be the biggest technological school in the world.
