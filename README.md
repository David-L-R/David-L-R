# üìñ Early life

I have had a passion for teaching and mentoring since I can remember. I have been tutoring other kids since I was 11, and at the age of 16, I opened an after-school program to help elementary school students prepare for junior high.

In high school, I chose physics and computer science as my majors, where I discovered my love for technology and science.
