# ðŸ”¥ Who

A technology-education specialist and software developer with extensive experience leading both teams and projects and over a decade of teaching students and training staff.

At the age of seven, I discovered an interest when I was teaching my stuffed animals the things I have learned in school. That early fascination has since expanded into a relentless passion that's only grown over time.

I firmly believe in cultivating a sense of intellectual curiosity and intrinsic motivation in learners. My objective is to foster independence in learning, thereby creating a breed of enthusiastic scholars who are passionate about their own educational growth and development.
