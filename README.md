# üìñ Early life

I have a passion for teaching and mentoring since I can remember myself. I have been tutoring other kids since I was 11, and at the age of 16 I opened an after-school program to help elemntry school students prepare for junior-high.

In highschool I chose physics and computer science as my majors, where I really discovered my love for technology and science.
